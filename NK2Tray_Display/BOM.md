## Bill of materials for the NK2Tray_Display

Printed Parts:
1x  NK2DisplayCaseA.stl
1x  NK2DisplayCaseB.stl
3x  NK2DisplayLatch.stl

As the case and the latches do not bear any load, you can use a low infill. 25% is more than enough. Use 2-3 perimeter walls The case is designed to be printed with the face on the print bed, that should get you a nice surface to look at.
Print the as they are designed and use supports under the overhang. Use at least 3 perimeter walls, again infill doesnÂ´t matter that much.
